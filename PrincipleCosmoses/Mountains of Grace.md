They vary in height but each one is at least 1000m. They are quite thin, instead of curving up like normal mountains, they are like spikes throwing themselves up through the ground.

## Passage of Grace

At the top of each mountain there can be an [[Oracle Soul]]. This is caused the the mountains being a kind of leak of [[grace]] from within worlds. Allowing it to become generalized and giving that [[Oracle Soul]] abilities not normally seen in that [[cosmos]].
