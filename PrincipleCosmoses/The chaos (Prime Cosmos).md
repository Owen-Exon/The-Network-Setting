## Overview

The chaos is the place where the worlds were created. (See [[The Genesis (Event)|The Genesis]]) It used to be the only place to exist. Known as the chaos because that is what it used to be, now it is calm and empty.

## Geography

The entire terrain of the chaos is rocky and uneven. There is no life here. Throughout the landscape are various [[Mountains of Grace|mountains]] spire-ing up from the ground. The largest of these is at the centre (or more to the point is used to define the center) and is known as [[the Arx]]. It used to be occupied by [[Genesis (being)|Genesis]].

## Grace

This is the only place where [[grace]] can become generalized again. And the only way that it can re-enter the [[cosmoses]] after being used.

It is also the only place that can exist without being saturated with [[grace]], having existed for grace did. This is why it is known as *Prime* [[cosmoses|cosmos]], and not just one of the [[principle cosmoses]]
