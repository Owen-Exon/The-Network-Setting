## Overview

[[Soul]]s flow through the river and fall through openings into different [[cosmos]]es. When they fall they lose any memory they have. If they die, they return to the place in the river where they were when they fell. The only way to keep memories is by climbing out of the river and onto the bank without getting pushed back by [[Mortis (Creator)|Mortis]]. If that is managed you will arrive in [[The Network (Principle Cosmos)|The Network]] with whatever body you create as you travel there.

## Vocare

The beginning of the river. This is where [[Soul]]s are born. During [[The Genesis (Event)|the genesis]] every being (excluding the 7) was absorbed into the newly created [[the Arx|Arx]]. Since then they have been slowly forming from [[grace]] within Vita.

## Augurai

The end of the river. An inverse waterfall where droplets slowly rise from the ground to meet the stars. [[Soul]]s rise up with it return to [[grace]].
