## Overview

The river of death was created by [[Mortis (Creator)|Mortis]] and allows life to cycle and exist in perpetuity.

## Sections of the River

### Vocare

The beginning of the river. This is where [[Soul]]s are born. During [[The Genesis (Event)|the genesis]] every being (excluding the 7) was absorbed into the newly created [[the Arx|Arx]]. Since then they have been slowly forming from [[grace]] within the branches of the Vita Tree.

The water here is still and shallow, barely flowing, just gently pushing [[soul]]s towards the main river.

#### The Vita Tree

It is a impossibly large mangrove like tree with uncountable [[soul]]s forming in its branches.

### The Main River

The water deepens and speeds up here. There are sections of rapids and sections where the water is deeper than the deepest oceans. But there are also shallow and calm sections. The river splits more and more as you travel down it.

As [[Soul]]s flow through the river they are pulled through openings into different [[cosmoses]]. When they do they lose their memories. If they die in that [[cosmoses|cosmos]], they return to the place in the river where they were when they left.

### Augurai

The end of the river. An inverse waterfall where droplets slowly rise from the ground to meet the stars. [[Soul]]s rise up with it return to [[grace]].

The water is shallow and calm.

## Souls in the river

In the river there are no physical bodies. Instead each soul takes a form on instinct as they enter. These forms can interact with each other but look ephemeral.
