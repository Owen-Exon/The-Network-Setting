## Overview

Grace is the binding force of the [[cosmos]]es. Without grace, everything falls apart. It defines the rules of the universe: how (and if) magic works, the laws of physics, everything. It is found saturating everywhere except [[The chaos (Principle Cosmos)|the chaos]].

Grace can either be Generalised or Specialised. Any form can be stored in a [[grace canister]] to transport through a [[Membrane (grace)|membrane]] and to stop it from spreading out.

## Generalised

Generalised grace is only found in the Principle [[cosmos]]es. This grace is effectively in its natural form. It can be shaped in any way. This allows someone of any [[analogies|analogy]] to use it. However someone trained with a specific type of specialised grace sill needs it to be specialised because you must be trained cast with Generalised grace.

## Specialised

Grace becomes Specialised in two ways.

The first is by casting generalised grace. As soon as it gets used by someone with a specific [[analogies|analogy]] it becomes specialised. But it also immediately returns to [[The chaos (Principle Cosmos)|the chaos]] (through [[the Arx]]) to be generalised again.

The second is by traveling through a [[Membrane (grace)|membrane]]. This is the mechanism by which the [[cosmos]]es become unique from each other. When magic is used within a world, it's no longer considered casting grace since it has become reshaped into something different.
