## Overview

The 4st Creator

> I am Axis. I join the worlds with a network. To allow all to meet and create what they could not alone.

Axis believed that the worlds shouldn't be separate but should be connected and so created [[The Network (Principle Cosmos)|The Network]]. It acts as a hub between the cosmoses. Because this worked against the goal of [[Cosmos (Creator)|Cosmos]], and because they are the 4th creator, traveling to and out of the network is still not easy.
