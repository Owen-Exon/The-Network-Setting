## Overview

The 2nd Creator

> I am Cosmos. I create worlds for all minds to inhabit. To bring us wonder and discovery.

Cosmos wanted to create words for people to explore and discover the secrets of. But they also didn't want the chaos of wars so instead of creating one [[cosmoses|cosmos]], they created many, all separate from each other in an attempt to stop people who would only see their differences from finding and fighting each other.
