## Overview

The 5st Creator

> I am Mortis. I create the river. To allow life in perpetuity, despite constant chaos.

Mortis thought that while [[Time (Creator)|Time]] adding chaos to the worlds was a good idea. They didn't like how it make life impermanent so quick to end, so created [[the River of Death (Principle Cosmos)|the River of Death]], allowing souls to be reincarnated and return to life again.
