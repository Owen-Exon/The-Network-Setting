## Overview

The 6st Creator

> I am Orion. I create impossible beings. To be strong where I am not. To avenge me.

Orion was bitter for being the weakest of the creators and so instead of creating something good for the [[cosmoses]], created something to wreak destruction: the [[Orion (Beings)|Orions]]. They are forces of pure destruction and feared by all.
