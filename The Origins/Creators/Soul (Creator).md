## Overview

The 1st Creator

> I am Soul. I create the vessels for the minds of all. To allow us to find freedom in imperfection.

Soul's aim was to create a way to limit beings to force them to take a permanent form and to live with it. Although there are ways of manipulating physical appearance, the creation still stands as [[Soul]]s can't exist without a body. (With rare exception)
