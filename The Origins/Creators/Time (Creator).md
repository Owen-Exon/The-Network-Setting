## Overview

The 3st Creator

> I am Time. I take a seed of chaos and plant it within all worlds. To give meaning with impermanence.

Time wanted to ensure that unlike [[The chaos (Prime Cosmos)|the chaos]] all worlds would change over time, and so placed a small seed of the chaos of before into the new worlds.
